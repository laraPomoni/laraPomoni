- ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m @laraPomoni
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in backend development and frontend development
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning design patterns, TDD and NodeJs in depth
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: (write me an email! at pomoni.lara@gmail.com).

I'v been working on myself to improve my development skills. I like working with other people and to challenge myself. 

# What are my knowledge? #
I finished attempting the school in 2020 and i've started working in a company since then. 
I've developed different skills expecially working on NodeJs and Laravel. Furthermore i had the opportunity to work on both document-oriented and non-document-oriented databases (MySql and CouchbaseDb).
Lately i've started learning about TDD and Design patterns because programming isn't only about writing code, it's about create an entire working logic.
